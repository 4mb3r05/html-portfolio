<hr />
<h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
<p>This is one of my favourite movies because of the amazing detail put into the artwork in each scene.</p>
<h3>Grease</h3>
<p>I love this film because growing up Me, my Mum and Grandma would watch it together.</p>
<h3>10 Things I Hate About You</h3>
<p>This film is the perfect Rom-Com with a heart-warming ending.</p>
<h3>Star Wars: prequals</h3>
<p>The star wars prequals are by far the best movies in the star wars franchise with the perfect balance of romance, sci-fi and politics.</p>
<h3>Murder Mystery</h3>
<p>Because who doesn't love a movie with Adam Sandler and Jenifer Aniston in.</p>
<h3>Knive's Out</h3>
<p>This is the perfect film for crime lovers with a light balance of comedy and lots of juicy drama.</p>
<h3>Us</h3>
<p>One of the best horror movies i have ever watched. You'll be on the edge of your seat for the entire movie and when you finally
     think you know what's going to happen, Jordan Peele will Prove you wrong.</p>
<h3>Halloween</h3>
<p>It is simply just a classic timeless horror that i love to watch every halloween.</p>
<h3>White Chicks</h3>
<p>White Chicks is a great chick flick and commedy movie to watch with your friends for a laugh.</p>
<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>I love all Studio Ghibli movies really but this one holds a special place in my heart.</p>
