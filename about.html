<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an 18 year old self-taught full stack web developer and software engineer currently completing the Udemy 2023 
  Complete web development course. In my spare time i like to code, go to the gym, play football and bake.I previously
 studied level 3 applied science extended diploma and opted for a change in subject as i decided i want to be a software engineer 
and full-stack web developer. </p>

<p>My inspiration for this career change was because of my cousin who is a software engineer working on contract currently. 
  I recently finished college and was struggling to decide what career path i wanted to persue and his advice helped guide me into 
  web development and software engineering. I have previously had an interest in coding and have coded with HTML, CSS and some Javascript 
  on exclusively personal projects and am now completing the course to give me more experience and knowledge on coding and so i can learn 
  new languages as well as other tools on top of the experience i have from working as an admin assistant and carrying out website imrpovements
  on SYFM ltd website.
